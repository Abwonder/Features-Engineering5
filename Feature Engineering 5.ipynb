    "\n",
    "__Answer__\n",
    "\n",
    "The major difference between both is that one is use to code catgorical variables with natural occurring order e.g levels of education __(BSc, MSc, PhD)__ while Label Encoding if used for coding categorical variables that does not follow a natural order e.g color __(red, white, green)__\n",

    "\n",
    "__Label Encoding__ assigns a unique numerical value to each category of a categorical variable, with no consideration of any order or hierarchy among them. For example, in a dataset with a \"color\" variable, label encoding would assign the values \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\" to the values 0, 1, and 2 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ordinal Encoding,__ on the other hand, assigns numerical values to the categories based on their order or hierarchy. For example, if the \"size\" variable in a dataset has categories \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\", ordinal encoding might assign the values 0, 1, and 2 respectively."

    "\n",
    "_Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Answer__\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two variables are related to each other. Specifically, covariance measures how much two variables vary together or co-vary. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other decreases. A covariance of zero indicates that there is no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Importance__\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps to identify how two variables are related to each other. It provides information about the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. Covariance is commonly used in finance to measure the risk and return of a portfolio. In data analysis, covariance is used to identify the strength of the relationship between two variables and to help select variables for regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the formula for covariance between two variables X and Y is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cov(X, Y) = (Σ[(X - μX) * (Y - μY)]) / (n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "μX is the mean of variable X\n",
    "\n",
    "μY is the mean of variable Y\n",
    "\n",
    "n is the number of observations\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the formula is a single number that represents the degree to which the two variables covary. A positive value indicates that the two variables have a positive relationship, while a negative value indicates a negative relationship. The magnitude of the covariance is difficult to interpret because it depends on the units of measurement of the variables. To overcome this, correlation, which is a standardized version of covariance, is often used.\n"
